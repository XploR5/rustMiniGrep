I am a little girl with moss-colored hair,
And I am quite, quite small, and I don't know where
To find a house to live in, or a bed;
And I don't know anything at all, it's said.

I think I must have come from far away,
For everything is strange to me to-day.
But everybody's kind, and that's a lot,
And I'm not really scared, I'm really not.

I'm going to grow up big and be a queen,
With a diamond crown and a velvet green
And ermine cloak, and a sceptre too,
And a throne of gold, with a silver blue.

And everybody will come to see me then,
And they will say, "How good we've always been
To her, and how we always knew
That she'd be a queen and a ruler too."

But now I'm tired, so I'll go to bed,
With a pillow for my tiny head;
And if I dream, then I'll be a queen,
With a diamond crown and a velvet green.
